===================================================================

Work developed throughout the 2024/25 Spring Semester of the Masters in Data Science for Social Sciences @ DCSPT, Universidade de Aveiro, Aveiro, Portugal, as part of the Semin√°rio course.

Our main goal with this work was to consolidate analyses (and above all, a process) through which we could extract, engineer and consolidate public available data on hourly Energy Consumptions throughout Continental Portugal. By crossing this information with hourly data on solar irradiation, we intended to make it possible for anyone to identify whether or not forming a Renewable Solar Energy Community would be viable in their neighbourhoods.

The "webapp" folder contains a compartmentalized interactive webapp version of the project, with corresponding Docker, HTML and utility files. The webapp is hosted at https://huggingface.co/spaces/hleme/seminario_app.
